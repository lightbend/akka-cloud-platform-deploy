# Akka Cloud Platform Deployment Pulumi Templates

There are two Pulumi templates available:

1. If you are using AWS, access the `aws` folder.
1. If you are using Google Cloud Platform, access the `gcp` folder

Both projects have similar structures, and you should follow similar steps to execute them.

## Requirements

1. Node 14 (use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install it if you haven't yet).
1. [Pulumi Account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup)
